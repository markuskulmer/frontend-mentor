## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup (BEM)
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I made the component responsive so it has a width from 350 to 450 px.
To achieve this, I set the padding of the card content using percentage values and applied object-fit: cover to the hero image.

If there is another, maybe even better way to achieve responsiveness, please let me know.
